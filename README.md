# Timeseries-Forecast

This is a Java open source library which provides a time series forecasting functionality. It is an implementation of the [Hannan-Rissanen algorithm](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2241884?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Paper") for additive [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average "Wiki") models. This library is published by the Workday's Syman team, and is used to support basic timeseries forecasting functionalities in some of the Workday products.

How to Use
---

In order to use this library, you need to provide input timeseries data as well as ARIMA parameters. The ARIMA parameters consist of a) non-seasonal parameters `p,d,q` and b) seasonal parameters `P,D,Q,m`. If `D` or `m` is less than 1, then the model is understood to be non-seasonal and the seasonal parameters `P,D,Q,m` will have no effect.

```java
import com.workday.insights.timeseries.arima.Arima;
import com.workday.insights.timeseries.arima.struct.ForecastResult;

// Prepare input timeseries data.
double[] dataArray = new double[] {2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5};

// Set ARIMA model parameters.
int p = 3;
int d = 0;
int q = 3;
int P = 1;
int D = 1;
int Q = 0;
int m = 0;
int forecastSize = 1;

// Obtain forecast result. The structure contains forecasted values and performance metric etc.
ForecastResult forecastResult = Arima.forecast_arima(dataArray, forecastSize, p, d, q, P, D, Q, m);

// Read forecast values
double[] forecastData = forecastResult.getForecast(); // in this example, it will return { 2 }

// You can obtain upper- and lower-bounds of confidence intervals on forecast values.
// By default, it computes at 95%-confidence level. This value can be adjusted in ForecastUtil.java
double[] uppers = forecastResult.getForecastUpperConf();
double[] lowers = forecastResult.getForecastLowerConf();

// You can also obtain the root mean-square error as validation metric.
double rmse = forecastResult.getRMSE();

// It also provides the maximum normalized variance of the forecast values and their confidence interval.
double maxNormalizedVariance = forecastResult.getMaxNormalizedVariance();

// Finally you can read log messages.
String log = forecastResult.getLog();
```

How to Build
